# Aerial Ops Code challenge

## MVP Goals

- [x] Learn TRPC and Zod (should add time to project; that's fine, ramp up should always be considered with deliverable timelines)
- [x] Create basic visual mockup of chat -- Not styled
- [ ] Begin working on trpc for endpoint functionality
- [ ] Create simple Chat room, no authentication
- [ ] Learn S3 (Should be simple, Experience with GCP and firebase will help out, so don't expect too much time investment outside of configuring to use **pre-signed Urls**)
- [ ] Deploy on Vercel
- [ ] Use Mongo
- [ ] Use S3

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] use [Optimistic Updates](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/optimistic-updates) for `msg.add` and `msg.delete`

- [ ] ensure that `msg.list` returns messages | urls for displaying images if they exist

- [ ] `msg.delete` should also delete any images

- [ ] implement [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) for component library stuff (Might retrofit once I get base functionality down, this is lower priority since I have to learn TRPC and Zod first.)
